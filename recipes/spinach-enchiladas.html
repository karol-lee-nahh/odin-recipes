        <h4>If you like spinach and Mexican food, you'll love these easy vegetarian enchiladas 
            made with ricotta cheese and spinach.</h4>
        <h5> Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/2cup sliced green onions</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, 
                thawed, drained and squeezed dry</li>
            <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>10 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1 (19 ounce) can enchilada sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h5> Directions</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add 
                garlic and onion; cook for a few minutes until 
                fragrant, but not brown. Stir in spinach, and cook 
                for about 5 more minutes. Remove from the heat, and
                mix in ricotta cheese, sour cream, and 1 cup of 
                Monterey Jack cheese.
            </li>
            <li>In a skillet over medium heat, warm tortillas one 
                at a time until flexible, about 15 seconds. Spoon 
                about 1/4 cup of the spinach mixture onto the center 
                of each tortilla. Roll up, and place seam side down 
                in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce over 
                the top, and sprinkle with the remaining cup of Monterey
                Jack.
            </li>
            <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until
                sauce is bubbling and cheese is lightly browned at the 
                edges.
            </li>
        </ol>
